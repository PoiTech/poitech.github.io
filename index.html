<p>We have already finished design three main characters for sale in Unity assetstore which are Samurai,Ninja,Rounin. 
Using nodachi,ninjato and katana in corresponding  martial art styles. Which are Jigen Ryu sword art,Ninjitsu,Iaijitsu.
The package is mainly a models and artwork pack.We are aiming to bring some authentic anime artwork to assetstore. 
The first release will be Rounin,other two will be released as we finished their basic animations.
We are also working on animations as a free give away. Also,each character we release,we will add a free enemy character in the pack.
The animations are still not in good shape,we will keep update it to match certain quality.And a full locomotion animation set will be in the update along with other attack movements,special moves,jump,dash,dodge etc.And of course,the updates  are free.</p>
